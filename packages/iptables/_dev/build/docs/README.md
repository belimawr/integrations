# Iptables Integration

This is an integration for `iptables` and `ip6tables` logs. It parses logs
received over the network via syslog (UDP), read from a file, or read from
journald. Also, it understands the prefix added by some Ubiquiti firewalls,
which includes the rule set name, rule number, and the action performed on the
traffic (allow/deny).

The module is by default configured to run with the `udp` input on port `9001`.
However, it can also be configured to read from a file path or journald.

To read Journald logs from within a container, you need to use the
[`elastic-agent-complete`](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/fleet/install-elastic-agents#elastic-agent-complete-flavor)
Docker image that contains the `jouranlctl` binary. Journal files can have breaking changes making it
impossible to read files generated by a newer versions of
Journald. Ensure the jounral files you are reading were generated by
a version equal or older than the `journalctl` shipped with the Docker
image.
